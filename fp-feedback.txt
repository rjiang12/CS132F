Please fill out the following and submit with your Final Project submission 
(added to help us know what to focus on when grading, what was intentionally incomplete, etc.):

1. What is your estimated grade for the Final Project (roughly of 100)? For partner projects,
   do you think the workload distribution was fair?
98? I met all criteria, and I think I put my best foot forward in breaking away from some of my bad habits I used to have to try and meet the requirements El has set out in this class. 

2. What is your estimated grade for the course (letter grade)? You can support your
   estimate with examples of demonstrated engagement in the course material, strengths
   (and weaknesses) over the term, and growth throughout the material (some assignment
   grading feedback was delayed, but we would like to know what resources you used to
   iterate on the material, such as lectures, OH, Discord, etc.)
A+. I had a decent background coming in, and I think picked up less hacky tricks and made my best effort to learn better style and habits as El sets out. 
Overall, I think my habits are much better now, and I have already been doing decently in homeworks and CPs to warrant a high grade ultimately. I also 
make the effort to go to OHs when possible to pick up better habits from El. 

3. To what extent would you like feedback in your project (e.g. thorough, particular areas of the
   project, or just a grade)?
A grade would really be all I need. 

4. Anything else you would like El to know when grading?
Not really - I tried my best

5. Are you open to sharing your project/reflection for future terms? If so, would you
   like named credit or anonymous?
I'm cool with it being shared, credit would be cool.
